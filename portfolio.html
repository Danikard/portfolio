    <h4> <strong>About Me</strong></h4>
    <p>My name is KARAMBIZI Danius Jonathan, 
        I finished my highschool in 2016 in art,
        at nyundo school of music and art.
        I continued my learnig journey at university of rwanda for two years before the pandemic in 2020
        I decided to join the wecode program because i needed an ascape.
        With things changing day by day i think technology is the escape.
        I needed skills to help solve problems and make a living doing  that. 
        I am currently interested and work as an artist part time but not much this days because i'm focused on a programming class.
        My hobbies when i have free time are,...
        <ul>
            <ol> <em>playing guitar</em></ol>
            <ol>eating</ol>
            <ol>work out</ol>
        </ul>

    </p>
