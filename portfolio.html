     <h5> <strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h5>
    <p>My name is KARAMBIZI Danius Jonathan, <br>
        I am 21 years old, single , currently a student<br>
        I finished my highschool in 2016 in art,<br>
        at nyundo school of music and art.<br>
        I continued my learnig journey at university of rwanda for two years before the pandemic in 2020<br>
        I decided to join the wecode program because i needed an ascape.<br>
        With things changing day by day i think technology is the escape.<br>
        I needed skills to help solve problems and make a living doing  that.<br>
        I am currently interested in art and part work as an artist,<br>
        I enjoy many differnt things in my free time like:
        <ul class="list"> 
            <em><ol>playing guitar</ol></em>
            <ol>eating</ol>
            <ol>listenig to music</ol>
        </ul>
